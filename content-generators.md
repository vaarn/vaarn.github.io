# Content Generators
Use the generators on the following pages to help bring Vaarn to life. They will help you create characters, locations, and objects that the players may encounter during their journeys. You will also find 100 strange and powerful Exotica that players could uncover in Vaarn's ruins, a selection of sample monsters, and rules for vehicles. Vaarn is intended to be different for everyone who plays in it, so these content creation tools are hopefully sparks for creativity rather than instructions.

## Petty Gods of Vaarn
Vaarn is the graveyard of faiths, some older than the very stars that shine overhead. Gods are carried here in the hearts of those who seek to make a life amongst the unending azure sands, and deities proliferate like ragweed across the desolation. A Vaarnish traveller would find it noteworthy to walk a day without encountering the remains of an enigmatic shrine to a member of a long-forgotten pantheon, a standing stone where blood was once spilt to appease a quantum daemon, or the abode of a hermit who still observed the rituals of an oblique and private devotion.
