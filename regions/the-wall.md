# The Wall
Of all the artefacts the ancients left littered across the cerulean sands of Vaarn, few are more imposing than the canted bulwark of pale ferrosteel that is known variously as the Great Wall of Vaarn, the Weeping Wall, the Backbone of the Gods, the Titanspine, or the Impediment. The Wall forms the western boundary of the trackless Vaarnish Interior, an artificial mountain range visible from a month’s ride away. At a distance it appears to be a colourless, irregular blockade that roils uneasily in the heat haze, more akin to the fortress-walls of ice that girdle the Urth’s polar regions than any work of human hands. Up close the Wall is more impressive still, a colossal ruin that exceeds four leagues in height, dwarfing even the Lazul Mountains that embrace its northern limit. The grasping white towers that crown the summit of the edifice reach beyond the stratosphere, although the creatures that roost upon these spires do not need oxygen to survive.

Suffice to say the Wall is large; an edifice so vast that it constitutes a biosphere apart from the rest of Vaarn, and there are peoples that dwell within its recesses to whom this construct is a universe unto itself, removed from the cares of those outside. These Wallborn live and die in a vertiginous world of passageways, shafts, vents, chutes, and great ferrosteel canyons built at scale far beyond the imagining of any man, in which their towns and keeps nestle like wasp hives in the eaves of an abandoned granary. Many of those born in the highest reaches of the Wall have never touched the ground, and these subjects of the Queen Beyond the Sky would die before they let the blue sands sully their feet. The Wallborn are expert climbers, having modified their bodies with prehensile tails and extra hands where the feet once were, and they are as confident traversing great heights as the great apes, thinking nothing of rushing across a knotted bridge of cables with a drop of a league or more beneath them. The purpose the ancients intended for this mighty construct is obscure, although most scholars believe the Great Wall to be a dysfunctional component of one of the Titan AIs, and given the sophistication of the engineering contained within it is difficult to dispute this notion. The construct has been described as a colossal neural cord, intended to transfer monumental quantities of data between disparate minds. The Wall appears to have served a secondary function as a coolant intake, and it is due to this purpose that it is able to sustain human populations within its bounds. The Wall draws in saltwater from the Sea of Songs, and transforms the liquid into pale ikor, the blood of the Machine Gods. The Wallborn drink deep of this ikor, which is ‘like nectar - it is sweet and fresh and filling, a superior fluid to water in all respects’ according to Idris Ida-Null, the lost Hegemony Cartographer. The veins that carry this liquid are riddled with leaks and breakages, and ikor runs freely down the interior surfaces of the Wall. It spills in trickles during some phases of the moon and in great rushing floods on other days, according to the cyclical operation of the Wall’s pumps. The sites of these ikor weeps are sought after and guarded, just as the oases in the badlands of Vaarn are coveted, for the Wallborn use ikor to nourish their livestock and irrigate the hanging gardens in which they grow many fruits.

There is a second type of ikor transported through the Wall - sable ikor, the Black Drink, a toxic brew too potent for any human to imbibe and live. It is whispered that certain abhuman entities covet this substance, for reasons obscure and likely inauspicious.
## Cities of the Wall
Two ancient and squabbling cities roost inside the Wall. The lower of the twinned polities is **Sargattea, the Narrow City**. Sargattea has grown like a scab around a wound in the Wall, a rusted fissure rent by some unknown power in the distant past. This passageway is the only method by which trade caravans can reach the ocean from the Vaarnish Interior, without taking a detour of hundreds of leagues through the mountains or into the toxic mangrove-labyrinth of Ikor Quag. Sargattea holds the Rusted Pass, and the lascannon of the Sargattean Guard will rain fire upon any who attempt the crossing without paying tribute.

What can be said of the Narrow City? The polity is known for its passions and its appetites. Sargatteans are famous for their bombastic poetry, for their rich wine and ornate musical romances, for the fiery and elaborate meals they prepare for guests, and for their daredevil antics on the battlefield, in business, and in their bedchambers. A Sargattean who takes no lovers outside marriage is thought, or so it is claimed, to be letting the city down.

Sargatteans are famous also for beetle husbandry: the city breeds pack- and war-beetles of prodigious size and excellent discipline, and these insects are one of Sargattea’s major exports. The Narrow City is influenced both by the culture of the deep deserts, and by the peoples who live on the shores of Vaarn: a marriage of sand and salt, as those fond of Sargattea are heard to say. In this way the lower of the Wall’s cities is a place that embodies transformation, for travellers are forever passing through, sailors and nomads and merchants and guildsmen moving from the ocean to the desert or from the desert to the ocean. The Narrow City is a vast dressing room where actors prepare their costumes for one stage or another.

The loftier of the twin cities is wind-scoured **Ostriel, the City Unconquered**. Ostriel is built in the upper reaches of the Wall, at the site of an ikor weep of great size and ferocity. The Ostrielese are reckoned aloof and haughty by those who trade with them, a reputation Ostriel’s citizens bear with pride. Where the Sargatteans are known as fiery and open, with no threat unvoiced and no compliment ungiven, the Ostrielese are by repute chilly and reserved, a people whose clothes are austere and whose greatest art is understatement.

Ostriel is ruled by flocks of harpies, who gather there in great numbers to honor the Queen Beyond the Sky, the title they give to their matriarch of matriarchs. These feathered chimera own all property and control all trade in the city, and such is their ferocity and their skill in airborne combat that Ostriel has never been conquered. This boast is not made in idleness: Ostriel has gone to war many times, and although the zeppelin armadas of Sargattea have attempted to breach her defences on countless occasions during the fractious relationship between the twin cities, no Sargattean soldier has walked the streets of Ostriel save in chains.

The citizens of Ostriel take great pride in their fierce reputation, believing the harsh weather and thin air of their roosting city to have bred a superior fighting force. The Ostrielese make a custom of never walking upon the ground, and those who must journey to other regions of Vaarn wear holy shoes with a harpy feather engraved on each sole, to symbolically protect them from the impurity that will otherwise seep into their bodies. Of course, the taint of such journeys can never entirely be removed, and ‘travelling’ families occupy a lower rung on the social ladder than those who have never left the heights of the Wall.

The enmity that exists between the two cities is legendary, and innkeepers throughout Vaarn know how to differentiate the accent of Sargattean and Ostrielese travellers, as mistaking one variety of Wallborn for the other can cause lethal offence. Sargatteans mock the citizens of Ostriel as slaves to feathered monsters, making loud jokes of the grotesque and humiliating sacrifices the sky-dwellers make to their harpy queen, while the Ostrielese laugh at Sargattea for the polity’s proximity to the dirt, a place fit, they claim, only for worms, faeces, and corpses.

Wars break out between the two cities with metronomic regularity, and each new generation grows up learning the same litany of outrages and aggressions that have been committed by the other side. Sargattea has won more battles, or so it is claimed, but has never breached the defences of the City Beyond the Sky, whereas Ostrielese armies have sacked the Narrow City on two well-remembered occasions. Sargattea was even subjected to rule by a puppet government of the Harpy Queen.

The occupation ended generations ago, but the scars run deep, and many Sargattean collaborators with the harpy regime fled to Ostriel when their city finally rebelled. These exile families roost there even now, dreaming of the day the Narrow City will be subjugated once more by the Queen Beyond the Sky: the day Sargattea’s zeppelins burn in their bowers and grey-coated Ostrielese air-hussars patrol the streets, the day they can finally return home.
## Using This Issue
This issue of Vaults of Vaarn presents Referees with a new region of Vaarn. The intent is to expand the setting by introducing a location that radically breaks from the established desert wasteland backdrop, while retaining thematic consistency. In some senses, everything about the game world has been reversed: Where the deserts of Vaarn are dry, here fresh water is available in abundance. Where the wastes are flat and open, the Wall’s interiors are tall and cramped. In other senses, nothing has changed: the PCs are still exploring the ruins of a post-apocalyptic, post-human world, where archaic and alien cultures thrive in the enigmatic ruins of the Long Ago.

The Wall can be used as a palette cleanser in a long-running Vaarn campaign, or it can be a campaign setting in itself, with the PCs hailing from the societies that have established themselves within the colossus. In either case, here are a few ideas for campaign hooks and rumours that might draw the PCs to the Great Wall.
### Trail Blazers
The PCs are in the employ of the Sargattean Guard (p.14), attempting to mark out a new trail between Sargattea and an outlying town. The route is to be cleared of hazards and painted with trail lines.
### Sky Pirates
The PCs have been charged with tracking down a group of notorious sky pirates to their zeppelin berth, high in the Upper Wall. Their employer, a merchant, wants her cargo returned intact. Anything else they find in the pirates’ den is theirs to keep.
### Sky Pirates, Redux
Alternatively, the PCs are a crew of sky pirates, mounting daring raids on mercantile zeppelins using their smaller, more nimble craft.
### Sable Ikor
The toxic black sludge that leaks from the Wall’s ducts is highly prized by science-mystics and alchemists across Vaarn. A fresh weep of sable ikor is reported to have sprung, and the PCs are hired by an alchemist to escort them to the source of the leak.
### Agents of the Krypteia
The PCs are operatives for Ostriel’s Secret Police, assassins and informants for the Queen Beyond the Sky (p.18). Enemies of the crown must die. From Sargattea to Ostriel and beyond they ply their dark trade, striking from the shadows in accordance with Chatelaine Occluria’s plans.
### Beetle Ranchers
One of the PCs receives a letter: a distant uncle has died, and left them his beetle ranch! They must travel to the Wall, take up ownership of the ranch, and inherit the ruinous debts that doubtless drove him into an early grave. The only way to clear the debt and honour your uncle’s memory would be to win the Grand Beetle Derby, held once a year in Sargattea.
### Hegemony Spies
The Hegemon, May His Name Resound Forever, has little influence over the affairs of the Wallborn. The military and economic power of Sargattea and Ostriel is such that the Hegemony are locked out of the Wall’s politics. However, the relationship between the cities is always one notch beneath boiling point. A protracted, pointless war between the polities would weaken both, allowing the Hegemon’s Legions to establish a foothold within the Wall. You are charged with ensuring the twin cities go to war.
### Stop the Levellers
They’re always trying to blow something up, but this time it’s different. Rumours swirl that those fanatics dug something up beneath the desert, a weapon that could actually level the Wall. Where are they keeping it? How can they be stopped? The PCs must race against time, aided by Sargattea and Ostriel in grudging alliance.
### Vault Raiders
The PCs are rootless, ruthless vagabonds who rely on their weapons and their wits in equal measure. The Wall is gigantic, and older than the mountains that stand in its shadow. Such a construct doubtless hides all manner of ancient techno-temples and polychromed crypts within its bowels. The priceless relics of a bygone age won’t pillage themselves.

## The Forty Families
- The Patrician caste of Sargattea. Descended from the original founding families.
- There are only 36 Families now, but that doesn’t have quite the same ring to it.
- Each Family is headed by a Patriarch, who expects absolute obedience.
- Sargattea is a democracy, but only members of the Forty Families may stand for the highest offices. Plebeians can vote, but expect to be paid for their support.
- High Priest, Judge, and Head Customs Official are amongst the most coveted positions.
- There is always an election happening in Sargattea, and two or more scions of the Forty Families are always competing for office.
### Sargattean Beetle Knight

### Sargattean War Beetle
### Allies
The Forty Families are rivals, but express their hostility through the legal system and elections rather than warfare. Every highborn family in Sargattea has at least one active court case against another family, and will be funding several election bids. The PCs may be useful as hired muscle, spies, or ‘election observers’ who must ensure a vote goes a particular way. Sargattean elections are comically corrupt, and are always won by whichever side is willing to spend the most on bribes. Working with one family will always make an enemy of two others.
### Enemies
While it is impossible to befriend every member of this squabbling Patrician class, it is quite possible to make an enemy of all of them. The only thing they hate more than each other is any hint of a threat to their dominance in Sargattean life. All 36 Families will unite ruthlessly against any changes that would give more power to the Plebeians of Sargattea, and there is nothing they will not do to crush any hint of a populist uprising.
## Priam Houndsfoot, Harbourkeeper of Sargattea
- The Harbourkeeper of Sargattea. Has won re-election countless times. Master of Docks, Weights, and Measures. Controls all trade in the Narrow City.
- Aged, frail, cunning. Presents himself as kindly and slightly deaf. Neither is true.
- Wears a mummified dog’s foot around his neck. Supposedly taken from the companion animal of Sargattea’s founding fathers.
- Secretly in contact with Chatelaine Occluria (p.19). Tells the Harpy spymistress everything she needs to know about Sargattea, in exchange for safe passage for his trading vessels in the Sea of Songs.
- Some have noted how lucky Houndsfoot’s ships are at avoiding Harpy raids, but nobody has ever proven anything.
### Ally
Priam is adept at reading social situations and discerning the character of others. He is aware of the need to make friends, and is open-handed with people he believes may help him. If the PCs make a name for themselves in Sargattea as noteworthy adventurers, he will want to meet them. He can offer almost any material wealth Sargattea has to offer, so long as the PCs are useful to him. Priam wants little for himself, having dominated Sargattea for decades, but his grandchildren are feckless and lazy, and he will ask the PCs to fix some elections on their behalf.
### Enemy
Priam operates behind closed doors, working against his foes without advertising his enmity. The PCs may not even be aware they have crossed him, for he will show a smiling face, but matters in Sargattea will begin to sour against them. Their quarters are repeatedly searched by guards, they are falsely accused of a crime, a suspiciously organised mob of drunks attempts to throw them from a bridge. Every official who owes their position to Priam will diligently obstruct the party’s ambitions. Priam’s greatest secret is his treasonous alliance with Chatelaine Occluria, and he will kill to prevent this being uncovered.

## Sargattean Guard
- The professional military of Sargattea. Wear uniforms of terracotta orange. Their symbol is a war beetle in a rearing pose.
- Enlist for five year terms. Generous veteran’s pensions await. Criminals sometimes serve in penal battalions, although this is unusual in modern times.
- Train relentlessly to repel Ostrielese invasion. Sargattea will never again be held in the Harpy Queen’s cruel talons.
- Infantry units (drilled to fight within the Wall), cavalry (ride war-beetles) and navy (confusingly the navy operates both conventional ships and war zeppelins).
- Forbidden from taking part in Sargattea’s civilian elections, a rule that is mostly observed.
- In compensation they are allowed to elect their own officers. This has mixed results.
### Sargattean Guard
### Allies
The Sargattean Guard is an organisation with one overwhelming concern: to resist Ostrielese power at all costs. There are no shades of grey in this conflict, which consumes all of their time and resources. If the PCs are seen to be opposed to Ostriel and the Queen Beyond the Sky, they are sure to make friends within the Guard, who will take all the help they can get. Typical favours the Guard may ask include scouting out Ostrielese troop movements, uncovering Ostrielese sabotage plans, rooting out suspected Krypteia agents, rescuing soldiers who have been taken prisoner, and so on.
### Enemies
Those suspected of an Ostrielese allegiance will be taken prisoner and questioned, and their belongings will be confiscated. Prisoners who can demonstrate a connection with an important Chatelaine or the Royal Roost may be ransomed in exchange for Sargattean prisoners; otherwise the usual sentence is death by hanging. The Guard have license to kill Levellers and pirates without trial, and such executions occur frequently.

## Grand General Dyud, Keeper of the Narrow Pass
- Battle-scarred New-Buffalo. Supreme commander of the Sargattean Guard. War hero; wins re-election every time.
- Dour, humourless, precise. Excellent tactician.
- Was an Ostrielese slave as a calf. Escaped to Sargattea. Hates Harpies.
- Wears a cloak made from the feathers of dead Harpy soldiers.
- Considered lowborn and graceless by the Forty Families. Wildly popular with the soldiers and commoners of Sargattea.
### Ally
Dyud’s blunt manners do not sit well with the Patrician families of Sargattea, but he is an excellent politician and has a sharp read on most members of the Forty Families. Dyud wants two things: to destroy Ostriel completely, and to maintain his elected position as Grand General long enough to achieve this. He will prove a true ally to any PCs who share his hatred of Ostriel, and use them for tasks his soldiers aren’t trained in: espionage and assassination. Dyud suspects Priam Houndsfoot has some alliance with Ostriel, but needs concrete proof before moving against the Harbourkeeper. In return Dyud can offer the PCs political protection in Sargattea, armed escorts when exploring the Wall, and use of war zeppelins to reach far-off locations.
### Enemy
Dyud’s enemies are not just the Ostrielese, but anyone who would make peace with them, and even those who profit from trade between the two cities. He considers all such people traitors, and would see them executed like common bandits if he could. His warmongering tendencies will become more pronounced if the PCs are seen to be influencing Sargattean politics in a peaceful direction. In extremis, Dyud would not be opposed to declaring a state of emergency and waging open warfare against Ostriel without the approval of Sargattea’s civilian leaders. A coup of this nature would raise the tempo of a Sargattea-based narrative and lead to a new, bloody war between the twin cities.
## The Royal Roost
- The seat of the Queen Beyond the Sky and her court. Its heraldic colours are purple and gold.
- Houses the Royal Family, as well as the eldest daughters of all major Harpy Chatelaines, who are sent to the Roost as companions/hostages for the Queen.
- Beneath the Harpies are ranks of flightless scribes, guards, flunkies, cooks, and porters.
- Alive at all hours with the business of government and the ritualised entertainments of Harpy society.
- The wind-scoured prisons below the Royal Roost are rarely opened. They are rumoured to house entire dynasties of prisoners, who were born in their cells and have never known freedom.
### Harpy Goldenwing
### Allies
The Royal Roost is riven by resentments and secret agendas, and as such it is difficult to envision the entire populace feeling friendly towards any group of PCs. In theory anyone who has the Queen’s favour has the favour of her Roost, and all courtiers will pretend to tolerate her favourites. Harpy PCs who become close with the Queen will find that other courtiers and even powerful Chatelaines must show them respect. The resources available to those with the Royal Roost’s favour are extensive: material wealth, access to the Queen’s archives, and perhaps even the keys to the sinister prison complex that hangs beneath the Roost like a black wasp hive.
### Enemies
It is impossible to navigate court politics in Ostriel without ruffling some feathers. Those seen as opposing the royal will can be executed at any time, or else imprisoned without charge and without hope of release. Anyone who cosies up to the Queen will find themselves the target of rumour campaigns, attempts to portray them as traitors, and even well-choreographed assassination attempts. The dangerous sports and showfights that the Harpy courtiers are obsessed with are the perfect venue for an ‘accidental’ death or two.
## Eyazema III, Queen Beyond the Sky
- The young monarch of Ostriel. She recently attained the crown after two of her elder sisters met with tragic accidents.
- Honey-coloured plumage and vivid golden hair. Always ripely scented and extravagantly garbed.
- Ruthless, energetic, hungry for glory. Favours action over words. Little patience for subtle schemes.
- Determined not to be a footnote in Ostriel’s history.
- Chosen for the throne by Chatelaine Occluria; believed to be easily manipulated due to her youth and reckless impatience.
### Ally
The Queen hungers for greatness, for plunder, and for a conflict that will occupy the attention of her most powerful Chatelaines. All of this points towards war with Sargattea. Eyazema III would see the Narrow City rent by her gilded talons, its people paying homage to the Queen Beyond the Sky. She is the most belligerent of the players in the Wall’s politics. All that prevents her from giving the order to strike is Chatelaine Occluria’s insistence that the time is not right.

Eyazema is not as witless as most believe, and is aware that she owes her ascension to the throne to the Krypteia’s support. She seeks two things: those who can help her sack Sargattea, and those who can help her remove the Krypteia’s sable noose from around her neck. Non-harpy outsiders may ironically be one of the few groups she can trust.
### Enemy
The Queen Beyond the Sky has many enemies. The Royal Roost’s vendettas are too numerous to count, and anyone who appears to take the side of the Queen’s foes can expect no mercy from her. Those who incur her displeasure will be arrested by royal troops, interred beneath the Royal Roost, and either forgotten entirely or brought up into the palace proper to compete in gladiatorial matches and lethal games of chance. Those who truly offend Eyazema will be hunted by her devoted Goldenwing warriors, to the ends of the Urth if necessary. There are gilt cages that hang above the grand entrance to the Royal Roost, and it is in these cages that the Queen’s most hated foes live out their final days, begging for death through skinless lips.
## The Krypteia
- Ostriel’s secret police and intelligence service. Masters of espionage, sabotage, and assassination.
- The Krypteia have spies and informants embedded everywhere: Ostriel, Sargattea, the wider Wall, and throughout Vaarn.
- Many of these informants have no idea who they really serve.
- The organisation’s upper echelon is a mystery cult, devoted to the worship of the harpy goddess Ikara, in her aspect as Bringer of Silence.
- The sworn sisters’ personal servants have their tongues removed, and their lips tattooed black.
- The Krypteia was established to inform and protect the Queen Beyond the Sky, but most in Ostriel know that the real power in the city is held within the walls of the Silent Spire.
### Queen's Shadow
### Allies
The Krypteia is a small organisation that casts a large shadow. The sworn sisters of the mystery cult number only a few dozen, yet through fear, bribes, and blackmail, they control thousands more. It is possible - indeed normal - to serve the Krypteia without ever meeting a sworn sister. Those useful to the organisation are not told who they are working for, and will be contacted under false pretences or through anonymous messages. Frequently the Krypteia pose as anti-Ostriel forces, such as Sargattean spies or Ostrielese dissidents. They will aid the PCs in oblique ways if their goals align, but regard all non-members as expendable pawns.
### Enemies
The enemies of the Krypteia are marked for death, in small black ledgers that are approved by Occluria herself. The Krypteia’s assassins are famed for their skill, and they specialise in deaths that appear accidental, or else eerie disappearances that occur in the dead of night. The Queen’s Shadows, devotees of murder, are dispatched in the most sensitive cases. They are experts in all manner of Vaarnish poisons, and attack with venomous arrows from great distances. If one assassin is killed, be sure that three more have already been taught your name and likeness.
## Chatelaine Occluria, The Queen's Left Hand
- The ancient high priestess of the Krypteia.
- Sable-feathered crone with a pale, milkyeyed face. Occult tattoos spiderweb her cheeks and hands.
- Cold, reclusive, feared. Hoarse, quiet voice.
- Occluria is the true ruler of Ostriel. She has ‘advised’ five Queens and outlived them all.
- Realises that elevating Eyazema to the throne was a mistake, and is struggling to keep a lid on the young Queen’s hunger for glory. A new royal accident may have to be arranged.
### Ally
Occluria is a strong advocate for peace between Sargattea and Ostriel. A hot war does not serve her interests, being too unpredictable and volatile. Anyone who advocates for peace is her ally, although they may not know this. Occluria will become aware of peace-making PCs before they are aware of her, and will aid them through underhanded means. They may feel themselves observed from afar, or notice strange preferential treatment extended by strangers who they have no prior connection with. Letters may be delivered anonymously, containing credible information that can be used to blackmail or even murder hostile NPCs. Occluria’s influence is felt most strongly in Ostriel, but Sargattea is also riddled with Krypteia agents.
### Enemy
Despite her desire for peace, Occluria is a sinister figure and makes an obvious villain for a Wallbased campaign. The Krypteia are a cold, brutal organisation and protect their leader zealously. Occluria will mark for death anyone who attempts to expose Priam Houndsfoot as her informant, anyone who attempts to help General Dyud destroy Ostriel, and anyone who attempts to help Eyazema go to war with Sargattea. This is not to mention the unspeakable deaths she will order for PCs foolish enough to ally with the Levellers. Occluria and her death cult inspire fear throughout the Wall, and for good reason.
## The Levellers
- *'All Walls Shall Fall.'*
- Fanatical mendicant cult, devoted to destroying the Great Wall down to the foundations. Their sigil is a crudely scrawled hammer.
- They have been attempting to destroy the Wall for millennia, without success.
- Egalitarian, scornful of possessions, attractive to outcasts.
- Speak feverishly about the coming Age Without Boundaries, in which all manner of creatures shall be set free from their bonds and live as brothers.
- The cult is proscribed and persecuted by Sargattea and Ostriel alike. Members know one another by secret signs and names.
### Leveller
### Allies
The Leveller cult’s mission is a singular one: to destroy a great relic of the Titans, an act so momentous most in Vaarn do not believe it could ever come to pass. The Levellers are devoted to this quixotic goal to the detriment of all else, and care little for other pursuits. Those who agree to aid them in their task are friends; all others are foes. The Levellers do not dwell in civilised areas of the Wall, but they are well-attuned to running and hiding, and ironically have an intimate knowledge of the construct they are sworn to destroy. PCs in the cult’s favour may find themselves transported through shortcuts and passageways unknown to the twin cities, and granted access to secret hideouts deep within the bowels of the structure. Levellers hold all property in common, and a PC who requires something from a Leveller need only ask.
### Enemies
The Levellers are hunted and despised by all other factions, for the obvious reason that they seek the destruction of the edifice so many call home. The fact that the cult have yet to achieve their goal, and have never once come close, is immaterial: even to speak of such an act is a crime, and PCs aligned with any Sargattean or Ostrielese faction will be expected to arrest or kill Levellers on sight. If the Levellers ever were to find some method of destroying the Wall, the consequences would be terrible, and reverberate throughout the entirety of Vaarn. The promise of an Age Without Boundaries has a menacing aspect, a dream that ensnares the unfortunate and spurs them on to acts of great destruction and cruelty.
## Qua, Prophet of the Fall
- Ancient synth, completely overcome by an iridescent vine that grows from their coolant tanks and ensnares every limb.
- Nobody is sure if the Prophet Qua is the synth or the vine, or some divine marriage of the two.
- Speaks at length in a clipped, confident voice, espousing the necessity of the Wall’s destruction and the untold bounties of the Age Without Boundaries.
- Impossible to interest in any other subject of conversation.
- Qua can barely move, and is carried by their devoted Levellers.
- Constantly moves throughout the Wall, from hiding place to hiding place, giving sermons to the lost and forgotten wherever they may dwell.
### Ally
Qua is fighting a guerrilla war against two powerful military forces, as well as against the unimaginably huge superstructure they live inside. The Prophet of the Fall is aware of the precariousness of their situation and the slim chance of success, yet this only serves to deepen their resolve. The Wall has been broken in the south, where Ikor Quag begins: This proves that somewhere on Urth is a weapon powerful enough to destroy the remainder. PCs who are in Qua’s favour are likely to be dispatched to far-flung locations, in search of clues to the identity of the weapon that can level the Wall. Their rewards will be spiritual in nature: the Prophet of the Fall cares little for material goods, and expects the same from their disciples.
### Enemy
Qua is a secretive, legendary figure throughout the Wall. The Prophet is whispered of as a mad machine, whose words lead the righteous astray, capable of breaking the will of any who listen to their sermons for long enough.

An obvious narrative in which Qua could play a villain role is one in which the Levellers have succeeded in finding some weapon that can destroy the Wall. This could be a war satellite, some kind of hypergeometric bomb, or a virulently fast-growing and powerful vine species. Destroying the Wall would destroy Sargattea and Ostriel as well, killing or displacing millions. The PCs would need to discover the nature of the weapon, and neutralise Qua before it could be deployed.
