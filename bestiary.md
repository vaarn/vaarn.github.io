Anyone implanted with an Argent Halo cannot commit any acts of violence, nor are they able to remove the Halo without expert surgical help. Attempting to harm any living being while wearing a Halo will result in the wearer passing out, with no save possible.<br />&nbsp; The Shepherd preaches in clear, ringing tones the futility of opposing the laws of THEMIS. It will reason with those it meets, attempting to convince them of the moral logic of accepting a Halo. </td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Hypergeometric humans that only have two dimensions. They can appear to be shadows or wall frescoes and surprise on 5-in-6. When they attack, they drain 1d4 points of STR from their target, as their touch pulls you into their flattened dimension. This hypergeometric effect fades over time.

When threatened it will rapidly brush its back legs across its back, showering the surrounding area with quills.<br />&nbsp; Quill-spiders are not venomous and rely on brute strength to subdue their prey, breaking the necks of addax and phthalo-jackals and dragging them into sheltered burrows to be devoured. These creatures are a menace to travellers in the Interior: they are inquisitive, fast-moving, aggressive, and will devour anything that fails to outrun them or fight them off.</td></tr>

Juveniles, between one and five centuries of age, are the size of passenger trains. Some are trained by the Faa to pull sand-sleds, while others roam free in the deepest Interior. Although not predatory, they can be very aggressive towards sources of unwelcome vibration, like heavy machinery or warding field technology.</td></tr>

The damage starts at d4 and will rise to d12. Prisoners of the tumblesnare must make an opposed DEX save to work their way free.
